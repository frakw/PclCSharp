D:\TOSHIBA_DT01ACA300\common\PclCSharp\src\PclSharpWrapper\include\boost-1_64\boost\iostreams\positioning.hpp(96,15): warning C4996: 'std::fpos<_Mbstatet>::seekpos': warning STL4019: The member std::fpos::seekpos() is non-Standard, and is preserved only for compatibility with workarounds for old versions of Visual C++. It will be removed in a future release, and in this release always returns 0. Please use standards-conforming mechanisms to manipulate fpos, such as conversions to and from streamoff, or an integral type, instead. If you are receiving this message while compiling Boost.IOStreams, a fix has been submitted upstream to make Boost use standards-conforming mechanisms, as it does for other compilers. You can define _SILENCE_FPOS_SEEKPOS_DEPRECATION_WARNING to acknowledge that you have received this warning, or define _REMOVE_FPOS_SEEKPOS to remove std::fpos::seekpos entirely.
